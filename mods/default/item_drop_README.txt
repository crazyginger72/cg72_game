===ITEM_DROP MOD for MINETEST-C55===
by PilzAdam and cy

Introduction:
This mod adds Minecraft like drop/pick up of items to Minetest.

Settings:

remove_items = integer
The number of seconds before dropped items expire and are removed.
1 hour = 3600 seconds
1 day = 86400 seconds

enable_item_pickup = true/false
If true then items will automatically zip up into the player like moths to a flame.
If false you have to focus on the items and click to get them.

enable_item_drops = true/false
If false, then digging a node will drop the node as an item entity, instead of directly adding the node to the player's inventory.
If true, it's basically like minecraft.
